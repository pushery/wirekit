## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-16

First stable release of WireKit — a free, MIT-licensed UI component library for
Laravel Livewire built on Tailwind CSS v4, Alpine.js, and PHP 8.4+.

### Added

- **71 Blade components** spanning form controls, overlays, navigation, display,
  feedback, and specialized categories — every component uses design tokens
  exclusively (zero hardcoded colors), auto-switches between light and dark mode
  via `.dark` class, and supports personalization via `WireKit::personalize()`.
- **Form controls:** Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Toggle, Radio Group,
  Range Slider, Color Picker, Date Picker, File Upload, Pin Input, OTP Input,
  Multi-Select, Combobox, Rich Text Editor (Tiptap).
- **Overlay components:** Modal, Drawer, Dropdown, Popover, Tooltip, Hover Card,
  Command Palette, Context Menu, Toast (with toast region), Confirm Dialog, Tour.
- **Navigation:** Navigation Menu, Breadcrumb, Pagination, Tabs, Stepper,
  Scroll-to-Top.
- **Display components:** Avatar, Badge, Card, Accordion, Timeline, Carousel,
  Image Compare, Scroll Area, Skeleton, Prose, QR Code, Clipboard Button,
  Collapsible, Separator, Resizable Panels, Tree View, Calendar, Stat Card,
  Data Table.
- **Feedback:** Alert, Progress Bar, Rating, Spinner.
- **Typography & layout:** Fonts (20 GDPR-compliant Google Fonts served locally),
  Icon system (4 presets: Heroicons, Lucide, Phosphor, Tabler with 26 semantic
  aliases), Chart (via Chart.js adapter).
- **Theming system** with ~80 CSS custom properties, 7 theme presets (Default,
  Minimal, Soft, Material, Brutalist, Retro, Slick), all WCAG 2.2 AA compliant
  in both light and dark mode.
- **Font system** — 20 locally bundled Google Fonts (9 sans, 5 serif, 6 mono),
  zero external requests, configurable via `config/wirekit.php`, served from the
  app's own domain for CSP and GDPR compliance.
- **Icon system** — pluggable SVG icon presets with resolved aliases, caching,
  and a `<x-wirekit::icon>` component that renders any icon by name.
- **Chart system** — adapter-based architecture with a Chart.js adapter, a
  class-based `<x-wirekit-chart>` component, and dark-mode-aware color tokens.
- **JavaScript bundles:** full bundle (Floating UI + focus-trap, ~76 KB),
  core bundle (chart + image-compare only, ~7.5 KB), and ESM bundle for
  tree-shaking.
- **Accessibility:** every interactive component follows WAI-ARIA Authoring
  Practices — proper `role`, `aria-*` attributes, keyboard navigation, focus
  management, screen-reader announcements via `aria-live` regions. Tour and
  modal use `role="dialog"`, combobox implements full ARIA 1.2 combobox pattern,
  all form components support error and description associations.
- **Personalization system** — three levels of customization: CSS variable
  overrides (theme presets), `WireKit::personalize()` for global class overrides,
  and `WireKit::scope()` for per-instance class overrides.
- **Reduced-motion support** — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables
  all WireKit animations and transitions, including skeleton pulse, progress bar
  indeterminate, and Alpine x-transition durations.

### Browser Support

Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 128+ — matching the Tailwind CSS v4
browser baseline.
